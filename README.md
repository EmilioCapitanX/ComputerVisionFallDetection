**Computer Vision Project** ðŸ¤–

This project aims to capture real-time video data to detect if a person has fallen and remains down for a specified period (based on the number of frames). Upon detection, it sends an alert to a designated first-aid contact.

This technology is particularly useful in environments with a high risk of falls, such as elderly care facilities or busy traffic areas.
